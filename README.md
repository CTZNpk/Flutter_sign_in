 Flutter Sign-In App

## Overview
This is a basic Flutter project demonstrating the implementation of a simple sign-in functionality. The project serves as a foundation for understanding how to set up user authentication and manage user sessions within a Flutter application. It uses Firebase as the backend for authentication and data storage.

## Features
- User-friendly sign-in interface.
- Basic state management for user session handling.
- Firebase backend integration for authentication and data storage.
- Extensible architecture for additional authentication methods.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure Flutter is installed on your system. You can download it from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **IDE**: Recommended IDEs are Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.

## How It Works
- The app provides a basic login form with fields for email and password.
- On submitting the form, Firebase handles authentication and data storage.
- Future extensions can integrate additional features such as Google or Facebook sign-in.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate Firebase Authentication for Google/Email sign-in.
- Add signup and password reset features.
- Implement secure storage for user sessions.
- Enhance UI/UX with animations and theming.
